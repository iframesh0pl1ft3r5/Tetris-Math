# Tetris Math made for: Hack-Oldham

# The Plan

ALL CODE WORKS <br>
A simple maths game that will allow the players to learn maths skills needed in a classroom. The game will be coded in vb.net and the questions will be randomly generated. 
After thinking about what game we want to "copy". We have decided to create a game of tetris which involves a math element.<br>
The game can be played by a keyboard. <br>
The game will like normal tetris but in order to release the block you will have to answer a math question correctly. If you get the questions wrong 5 times the player will also lose the game (as well as the blocks reaching the top of the screen).<br>
